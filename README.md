NIFTY 50 Volatility Forecasting with GARCH Models
This project forecasts stock market volatility for the NIFTY 50 index using the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. It leverages Python for data processing, Apache Spark for big data handling, Spark SQL for querying, and Plotly/Seaborn for visualizations. The project demonstrates skills in econometrics, time-series analysis, and big data, making it relevant for fintech roles at companies like Zerodha, Groww, or consulting firms like Deloitte.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Apache Spark (with Java installed)
Optional: AWS account for S3 storage

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Fetch Data:
python src/data_fetch.py

Downloads NIFTY 50 historical data using yfinance.

Preprocess Data:
python src/preprocess_spark.py

Computes log returns using Spark.

Run SQL Queries:
python src/sql_queries.py

Analyzes high-volatility periods and yearly returns.

Fit GARCH Model:
python src/garch_model.py

Fits GARCH(1,1) and forecasts volatility.

Visualize Results:
python src/visualize.py

Creates interactive (Plotly) and static (Seaborn) plots.


Results

Fitted a GARCH(1,1) model to NIFTY 50 log returns, capturing volatility clustering.
Forecasted 5-day volatility with RMSE evaluation against realized volatility.
Visualizations highlight historical trends and forecast accuracy.

Applications

Risk Management: Forecast volatility for Value-at-Risk (VaR) calculations.
Option Pricing: Provide volatility inputs for Black-Scholes models.
Portfolio Optimization: Adjust asset allocations based on predicted risk.

Future Improvements

Implement asymmetric GARCH models (e.g., EGARCH, TARCH) to capture leverage effects.
Integrate cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud).
Extend to individual stocks or other indices.
